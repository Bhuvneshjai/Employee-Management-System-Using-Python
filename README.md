# Flight-Fare-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

## 1. Research flight fare prediction and determine that linear regression and random forest are potential machine learning algorithms to use.
## 2. Collect and preprocess flight data, which may include cleaning and transforming the data into a format that can be used to train the machine learning models.
## 3. Train the machine learning models using the preprocessed flight data with the scikit-learn library. This may involve splitting the data into training and testing sets, scaling the data, and selecting appropriate features for the models.
## 4. Set up a Flask application to serve the machine learning models and provide a web interface for users to input flight details and receive a fare prediction. This may involve creating a Flask app object, defining routes, and implementing functions to handle user input and return fare predictions.
## 5. Create an index.html file to render the web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This may involve using a front-end framework such as Bootstrap to help with the layout and styling of the web page.
## 6. Integrate the machine learning models into the Flask application by calling the trained models from the functions that handle user input. This may involve loading the saved models using the joblib library and using them to make fare predictions based on the user input.
## 7. Configure the necessary routes and functions to handle user input and return a fare prediction. This may involve using Flask's request object to extract user input and returning the predicted fare as a response.
## 8. Test the application and make adjustments as necessary to ensure accurate and reliable fare predictions. This may involve testing the application locally on your computer using the Flask development server, as well as testing it on different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.
